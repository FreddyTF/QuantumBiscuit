To achieve better probability results it is necessary to optimize Soft- and Hardware.
Software improvements for our program include noise optimization as well as a hardware oriented
gate structure.

Hardware optimization was achieved by running the program on a Quantum Computer with the highest
Quantum Volume possible.

By combining all of these techniques, the probability increased by 10%.
