[//]: <> (Freddy Initial Experiment)

After basics about quantum computing, a detailed explanation of the Quantum Biscuit Tester comes. 
We describe a realisation of this experiment in qiskit and analyse the result.
From a phsyical point of view about the experiment, we improve the experiment by adapting 
components of the quantum biscuit tester and using the quantum zeno effect.
After that we analyse our own improvement and the 
improvements by Maria Volaris.

[//]: <> (Niklas Optimization)
To achieve better probability results it is necessary to optimize Soft- and Hardware.
Software improvements for our program include noise optimization as well as a hardware oriented
gate structure.

Hardware optimization was achieved by running the program on a Quantum Computer with the highest
Quantum Volume possible.

By combining all of these techniques, the probability of the wanted result increased by 10%.
